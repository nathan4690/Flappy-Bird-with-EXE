NOTES:
- You can click any keyboard button or click your mouse in the game window to make the bird flap.
- Medals are calculated with score like the following:
  + Score > 29: Gold
  + 30 > Score > 19: Silver
  + 20 > Score > 9: Bronze

- Best score is compared with the all best score in the leaderboard.
- If you don't type your name in the ask dialog or exit it, the default name will be 'Anonymous'.
